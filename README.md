# hakatime-tracker-slack-bot
A very complex Hakatime tracker, that requires a main server ( no public IP required ) and a Cloudflare server-less Worker.

It monitors your Hackatime activity and posts a message in your channel of choice for every one hour you work on your projects, with the ability to hide projects from being broadcasted if they are private or personal.
